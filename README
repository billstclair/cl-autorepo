cl-autorepo is a simple lisp library to ease inclusion of
non-Quicklisp libraries from repositories.

For example, to load my File System DataBase library:

  (ql:quickload "cl-autorepo")
  (cl-autorepo:find-system "fsdb" "https://github.com/billstclair/fsdb" :git)
  (ql:quickload "fsdb")

You can add ADD-SYSTEM calls to your library system definition (.asd)
files, to auto-download systems that aren't yet in Quicklisp.

Downloaded systems are kept in the "systems" sub-directory of the
cl-autorepo source directory. For now, you've got to arrange for
cl-autorepo to be known to ASDF. Hopefully, Zach Beane will add it
soon to Quicklisp. Until then, put the following in the file
~/.config/common-lisp/source-registry.conf.d/cl-autorepo.conf:

  (:source-registry
    :inherit-configuration
    (:directory "/path/to/cl-autorepo/"))

changing "/path/to" to the path to wherever you put cl-autorepo on
your system.

There is currently no support for updating libraries. You can easily
do that yourself with "git pull", "svn update", etc.

I've included support for git, svn, darcs, and hg. You can add another
respository type with a simple DOWNLOAD-REPO method. Send it to me,
and I'll add it.

One way to autoload cl-autorepo itself is the code below:

(unless (ql:quickload "cl-autorepo")
  (asdf:run-shell-command
   "mkdir -p ~/lisp;cd ~/lisp;git clone https://github.com/billstclair/cl-autorepo")
  (load "~/lisp/cl-autorepo.asd")
  (ql:quickload "cl-autorepo"))
